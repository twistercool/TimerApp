Kotlin implementation of a tiemr App.
The first page is an overview of he timers that have been created.
You can add timers to the main overview on a separate page.
You can start every timer in a separate window.
You can edit the timers in another window.

It still looks rough since the assets aren't finalised, but the code underneath is mostly final.

Some changes that are going to be made soon:
-visual overhaul
-add touch feedback
-make the listview end before the "add new timer" button on the overview screen
